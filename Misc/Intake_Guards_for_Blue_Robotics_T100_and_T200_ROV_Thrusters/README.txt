# Summary

This is a weed guard for use with Blue Robotics T100 and T200 thrusters. The front unit mounts under the stock nosecone. You will need two 10mm M3 stainless cap head bolts to mount this, the stock bolts are not long enough.  The rear guard mounts to my reinforced motor mount using two M3 bolts and nuts, lengths to be determined based off your hull needs. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1497003

Please note that this intake shroud will reduce your overall thrust and top speed slightly. It is intended for use in areas where there is a high amount of seaweed or other debris that could foul the thruster, and the lower thrust is offset by the greater protection.

Notes: 
I printed this in ABS. It uses a metric crapton of support. You will actually print more support than the actual thing. PLA or other plastics could also work, though you may want some springyness to it.
